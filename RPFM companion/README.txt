turns out that RPFM is too fat to include in a single commit so you get an empty folder instead
just install/exstract it here and it sould work (after you fix the paths)


RPFM may reqire a few downloads to set up, all internal and automatic.

get the assembly kit from steam
go to "packFile->prefrances"
set the game and assembly kit locations
go to "special tools-> warhammer2->regenerate dependencies"
